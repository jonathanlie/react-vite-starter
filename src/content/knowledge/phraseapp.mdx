PhraseApp was used extensively in Rewards Dashboard (Ascenda) as the source of truth for translations for different locales and different partners.

## Dev workflow

We would have separate locale files for specific partners (e.g. anz-en-AU.json). Devs would use a local file translations/en.json where they can write a command to merge into an existing partner's translation file. This is to ease manual typing and merging when they work on new features that had to utilize specific translation keys.

Translations would then be pushed to a separate PR, where multiple devs can update the translations first before pushing their feature PR.

We would then be able to push and pull translation updates from Phraseapp. The updates would be done per partner and per locale, and be distributed to their respective correct files (e.g. anz-en-AU.json, hyundai-kr.json).
